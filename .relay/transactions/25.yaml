  test: add failing test case for typescript error output

  Adds a new test case to the core extraction logic fixtures. This test uses a
  real-world TypeScript compiler error log as input and expects a clean,
  de-duplicated list of file paths.

  This test currently fails due to noisy and incomplete path extraction,
  capturing the issue identified in a prior user interaction. It serves as the
  basis for improving the path extraction regex and cleanup logic.
promptSummary: >-
  Implement a test case based on a conversation about handling TypeScript
  compiler error output.
reasoning:
  - >-
    Based on our conversation, the current path extraction logic produces noisy
    results when processing TypeScript compiler errors. To address this, I will
    add a new test case to the unit test fixtures. This test case will use the
    exact TypeScript error log from our discussion as input and specify the
    clean, de-duplicated list of file paths as the expected output.
  - >-
    This test will fail with the current implementation, which is the correct
    first step in a test-driven development approach. It formally captures the
    requirement and will allow us to verify the fix once it's implemented.
  - '### Add TypeScript error log test case'
  - I'll add the new test case to `test/unit/core.fixtures.yaml`.

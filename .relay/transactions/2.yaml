  feat(core): implement path extraction and verification logic

  - Implement `extractPaths` using a robust regex to find file paths (Unix,
  Windows, relative, absolute). - Use a higher-order function
  `createPathExtractionPipeline` to build a clean, multi-step process for
  cleaning, uniquing, and resolving paths. - Implement `async verifyPaths` to
  efficiently check for file existence using `Bun.file().exists()` and
  `Promise.all`. - Export `Options` type for clear API contract.
promptSummary: >-
  Implement the core logic for pathfish, using a robust regex and a functional,
  HOF-based pipeline for extracting and verifying file paths.
reasoning:
  - >-
    Of course. I will now implement the core logic for `pathfish`, focusing on a
    robust, multi-pass approach to path extraction as you've requested, and
    ensuring the code follows a functional, high-order function (HOF) style.
  - '### Step-by-step Reasoning'
  - >-
    1.  **File Creation**: I'll start by populating `src/core.ts`, which will
    house the main logic.
  - '2.  **`extractPaths` Implementation**:'
  - >-
    *   I'll define a robust regular expression (`PATH_REGEX`) that serves as
    the primary mechanism for finding path-like strings. This regex is designed
    to identify Unix, Windows, absolute, and relative paths that contain a file
    extension, which is a strong signal to differentiate them from other text.
    It will also capture optional trailing line and column numbers (e.g.,
    `file.ts:10:5`).
  - >-
    *   To satisfy the request for a "HOF-style" implementation, I'm creating a
    `createPathExtractionPipeline` higher-order function. This function takes
    the user options and returns another function that performs the multi-step
    extraction process on the input text.
  - '*   The pipeline will be composed of clear, distinct steps:'
  - 1.  Execute the regex to find all raw matches.
  - 2.  Clean each match by stripping the line/column numbers.
  - 3.  Apply uniqueness filtering using a `Set`.
  - >-
    4.  Resolve paths to absolute form if requested, using Node.js's `path`
    module.
  - '3.  **`verifyPaths` Implementation**:'
  - >-
    *   This `async` function will take an array of paths and filter it down to
    only those that exist on the filesystem.
  - >-
    *   It will leverage `Promise.all` and `Bun.file(path).exists()` to perform
    these checks concurrently for maximum performance, which is a key benefit of
    the Bun runtime.
  - >-
    *   The implementation uses `map` to create the promises and `filter` to
    return the final list, adhering to the functional style.
  - >-
    This approach ensures the core logic is powerful, configurable, and easy to
    understand and test due to its modular, functional design.

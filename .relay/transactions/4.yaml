  feat(api): create public API entry point

  Populates `src/index.ts` to serve as the official library entry point. This
  change exposes the core functions `extractPaths`, `verifyPaths`, and the
  `Options` type for programmatic use.

  Additionally, it introduces `copyPathsToClipboard`, a new async function
  tailored for the public API that takes an array of paths, formats them as a
  list, and copies them to the clipboard. This completes the feature set
  promised in the README for both CLI and library usage.
promptSummary: >-
  The user requested to execute part 4 of the plan, which is to finalize the
  library's public API by populating src/index.ts with the correct exports,
  while being mindful of using Higher-Order Functions.
reasoning:
  - >-
    Of course. I'll execute the final part of the plan, which is to create the
    public-facing programmatic API entry point. This will make `pathfish` a
    dual-purpose package, usable both as a CLI tool and as a library in other
    TypeScript projects.
  - >-
    I've reviewed the existing code, and it already makes good use of
    Higher-Order Functions (HOFs) like `createPathExtractionPipeline` and
    `createFormatter` where they make sense for creating configurable pipelines.
    I will maintain this design. For the public API, I will export the core
    functions as well as a new convenience function for clipboard operations, as
    outlined in the `README.md`.
  - '### Finalizing the Library Exports'
  - >-
    I will replace the placeholder content in `src/index.ts` to create the
    official public API for the `pathfish` library. This file will re-export the
    core functions from `./core.ts` and add the `copyPathsToClipboard` function,
    which is designed for programmatic use and formats the paths as a simple
    list before copying.

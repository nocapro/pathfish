  test: add integration tests for fuzzy strategy ambiguity

  This commit adds two new integration test cases to `engine.fixtures.yaml` to
  validate the improved fuzzy matching logic.

  1. A test case to confirm that when a full path is provided in the input, the
  fuzzy strategy correctly disambiguates and does not include other files that
  merely share the same basename. This serves as a regression test for the
  recent fix.

  2. A second test case to verify that when the input is genuinely ambiguous
  (containing only a basename), the strategy correctly falls back to including
  all potential file matches. This ensures the "fuzzy" capability is preserved
  where appropriate.
promptSummary: >-
  The user requested adding regression tests to cover the fuzzy matching
  false-positive scenario I just fixed.
reasoning:
  - >-
    Excellent point. Adding regression tests is a critical step to ensure the
    fix is robust and to prevent this issue from recurring. I will add new test
    cases to the integration test suite that specifically reproduce the false
    positive scenario and verify that my fix resolves it correctly.
  - '### Step-by-step reasoning:'
  - >-
    1.  **Identify the test file**: The best place to add a test case that
    involves file system interaction and the fuzzy strategy is
    `test/integration/engine.fixtures.yaml`. This file drives the integration
    tests for the core pipeline.
  - '2.  **Design the primary test case**:'
  - >-
    *   **Goal**: To prove that when a full path is mentioned, the fuzzy
    strategy no longer incorrectly includes other files that just share the same
    basename.
  - >-
    *   **Setup**: I'll create a file structure with two files named `db.ts` in
    different directories.
  - >-
    *   **Input**: The input text will explicitly reference *one* of those full
    paths (`src/core/db.ts`).
  - >-
    *   **Expected Output**: The result should *only* be the single, specific
    path mentioned in the input, not both `db.ts` files.
  - '3.  **Design a secondary test case**:'
  - >-
    *   **Goal**: To ensure the "fuzzy" aspect is preserved when the input is
    genuinely ambiguous (i.e., it *only* contains the basename).
  - '*   **Setup**: I''ll use the same file structure as the primary test case.'
  - '*   **Input**: The input text will only mention the basename `db.ts`.'
  - >-
    *   **Expected Output**: The result should include *both* `db.ts` files,
    because, in this case, both are plausible matches.
  - >-
    By adding these two cases, I can confirm that the logic is now more precise
    when context is available, but still helpful when the input is vague.
  - '### Code changes:'
  - I will add the new test cases to `test/integration/engine.fixtures.yaml`.
